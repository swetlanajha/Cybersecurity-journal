# Day 3: Network Fundamentals (Part 2)

## Date: January 20, 2026
### Status: Day 3 Completed ✅

I've officially wrapped up the **Network Fundamentals** section of the TryHackMe Pre-Security path! Today's session was more technical, focusing on the underlying layers and protocols that make global communication possible.

## What I Covered Today:

* **OSI Model:** Deep-dived into the 7-layer framework (Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application). Understanding these layers is essential for troubleshooting and identifying where specific security vulnerabilities exist.
* **Packets & Frames:** Learned how data is broken down into smaller chunks for transmission. I explored the structure of an IP packet and an Ethernet frame, including headers and payloads.
* **Extending Your Network:** Explored how networks scale beyond a simple LAN, covering concepts like Port Forwarding, Firewalls, and how the internet functions as a "network of networks."

## Reflections
The OSI model is definitely a lot to memorize, but seeing how each layer interacts—from the physical cable to the web browser—makes the "magic" of the internet feel much more logical. Completing the networking modules gives me a solid foundation before I move on to learning about different Operating Systems.

**Onwards to Day 4!**
