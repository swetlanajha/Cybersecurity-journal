# Day 1: Starting the Journey - Pre-Security Path

## Date: January 18, 2026
### Status: Day 1 Completed ✅

I have officially kicked off my cybersecurity journey on **TryHackMe**! To stay accountable and track my progress, I’ll be documenting my daily learning process right here in this repository. 

Today, I focused on the foundational concepts within the **Pre-Security Path**. It’s crucial to understand the "why" and the "who" of the industry before diving into the technical "how."

## What I Covered Today:

* **Offensive Security Intro:** Explored the world of ethical hacking, red teaming, and the mindset required to find vulnerabilities.
* **Defensive Security Intro:** Learned about the "Blue Team" perspective—how organizations protect themselves, detect threats, and respond to incidents.
* **Careers in Cyber:** Researched the different roles available in the field and mapped out potential career trajectories.

## Reflections
The distinction between offensive and defensive security is much clearer now. I’m excited to dive deeper into the technical fundamentals as I progress through this path.

**Onwards to Day 2!**
