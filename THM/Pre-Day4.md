# Day 4: How the Web Works (Part 1)

## Date: January 21, 2026
### Status: Day 4 Completed ✅

Today I transitioned from general networking to the specific protocols that power the World Wide Web. Understanding how a browser requests a page and how a server delivers it is a core skill for any security professional.

## What I Covered Today:

* **DNS in Detail:** Learned how the Domain Name System acts as the "phonebook of the internet," translating human-readable names like `google.com` into IP addresses. I explored the hierarchy of DNS, including:
    * Root Servers
    * TLD (Top-Level Domain) Servers
    * Authoritative Nameservers
* **HTTP in Detail:** Deep-dived into the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. I learned about:
    * **Request Methods:** GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
    * **Status Codes:** Understanding 200 (OK), 404 (Not Found), and 500 (Server Error).
    * **Headers:** How metadata is passed between the client and the server.

## Reflections
Learning about DNS was eye-opening—it’s amazing how many steps happen in milliseconds just so I can load a website. Understanding HTTP headers is also making me realize how much information we leave behind every time we visit a site. I’m looking forward to finishing the "How the Web Works" module tomorrow!

**Onwards to Day 5!**
