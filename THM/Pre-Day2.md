# Day 2: Network Fundamentals (Part 1)

## Date: January 19, 2026
### Status: Day 2 Completed ✅

Today was all about the backbone of the internet: **Networking**. You can't secure what you don't understand, so I spent my second day on the Pre-Security path at TryHackMe diving into how devices actually talk to each other.

## What I Covered Today:

* **What is Networking?:** Learned the basic definition of a network—a collection of computers and devices connected together to share resources and data.
* **Intro to LAN (Local Area Network):** Explored how devices connect in a localized area like a home or office. This included learning about:
    * **Routers:** The gateways that connect different networks.
    * **Switches:** The devices that connect multiple devices within the same network.
    * **IP Addresses:** How devices are identified on a network.
    * **MAC Addresses:** The physical hardware addresses of devices.

## Reflections
Networking felt a bit intimidating at first, but breaking it down into "Local Area Networks" made it much easier to visualize. Understanding how data packets travel from my laptop to a router is a huge step in understanding the attack surface of a system.

**Onwards to Day 3!**
