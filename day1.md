## 🛣️ My Journey & Roadmap

As I’ve committed to myself to follow my passion, since the last few days I was researching and watched almost every YouTube videos on the roadmap of Cyber Security. I ended up getting a lot of knowledge mainly about the domains:

* **Defensive Security**
* **Offensive Security**
* **GRC**

And my interest towards defense developed. Then I decided to start my journey. So, here I am starting my Day 1 learning about networks.
I’ll be doing hands-on labs, studying consistently, and documenting everything here honestly, including mistakes, lessons, and small wins.
